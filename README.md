Chegg and Bartleby Discord Bot 
This Bot is Basically in Java Script.I Designed it basically for that person which have some of the account of chegg and bartleby and want to help the community
by giving them free answers through discord i donot know how the community will use this bot either to make money from it or whatever i designed it becuase i love
to help students across the globe that cannot afford chegg and bartleby subscripton.

Requirnmets for this script to run:
1)Subscription of Chegg or Bartleby.
2)Visual Studio Code(Recommeneded)
3)You have to install the Node js first(https://nodejs.org/en/download/) then following Node Javascript Modules Otherwise the code will not run
->npm install discord.js
->npm i puppeteer
->npm i fs
->npm i puppeteer-extra
->npm i puppeteer-extra-plugin-stealth  
All of these above npm commands you have to paste in the termianl in the visual studio code open the visual studio code and create a node js or java script file and then paste the code or you can import the git repository whatever you like if the terminal window not showing in visual studio code click on view and click on open termainal hmmm  be sure while installing set the node js add to path to install all these in termianl without interruption 
4)Chegg human verification is hard to bypass but you can avail paid captcha website and put the script of them in my code so the captcha problem will be fixed.
This problem only occurs with chegg not with bartleby
5)Need any help regarding code i'm here.
6)Donot copy paste my code on any other website without my permission.
