# Chegg-Bartleby Discord Bot

## Overview
This Discord bot, written in JavaScript, is designed to assist users with Chegg and Bartleby accounts by providing free answers on Discord. The intention behind creating this bot is to contribute to the global community of students who may not have the means to afford Chegg and Bartleby subscriptions.

## Requirements
To run this script, ensure the following requirements are met:

1. Subscription to Chegg or Bartleby.
2. Visual Studio Code (Recommended).
3. Node.js installed. Download it [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), and then install the following Node.js modules by running the following commands in the terminal:

    ```
    npm install discord.js
    npm i puppeteer
    npm i fs
    npm i puppeteer-extra
    npm i puppeteer-extra-plugin-stealth
    npm i user-agents
    ```

    Open Visual Studio Code, create a new Node.js or JavaScript file, and paste the code. If the terminal window is not visible, click on "View" and select "Open Terminal." Make sure to set Node.js to add to the PATH during installation.

4. Chegg human verification may be challenging to bypass. Consider using a paid captcha-solving service and integrate the script accordingly to resolve captcha-related issues. Note that this problem is specific to Chegg and not Bartleby.
5. For any coding assistance, feel free to reach out.
6. Do not copy and paste the code on any other website without explicit permission.

## Note
Looking forward to your support!
